## Projects <a name="projects"></a>

Here are some of the key projects and research I've worked on:

### 1. Job Matching Information Retrieval System
   - **Description**: Developed an information retrieval system to match job seekers with relevant job postings based on their skills and work experience. Designed ranking algorithms using BM25 and text matching techniques to improve recommendation accuracy.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Information Retrieval, BM25, APIs, SQL

### 2. Survival Prediction for Cancer Patients
   - **Description**: Implemented machine learning models to predict cancer patient survival based on tumor images. Developed feature extraction techniques and optimized ensemble models to enhance prediction accuracy.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, CNN-RFR, ResNet18
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Hyeonjha/cancer-survival-prediction)

### 3. Image Similarity Search Service (Internship Project)
   - **Description**: Built a deep learning-based image similarity search service using ConvNeXt and EfficientNetV2. Improved the embedding extraction process and database querying speed by integrating Weaviate with PostgreSQL.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, ConvNeXt, EfficientNetV2, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Weaviate, Apache Kafka
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Hyeonjha/AIV_ImageEmbedding)

### 4. Dynamic Hot Data Identification (Research Assistant Project)
   - **Description**: Conducted research on dynamic hot data identification for storage systems, leading to the development of a novel stack distance approximation scheme that improved performance by 49.8%. Published two patents on data classification techniques and authored a first-author research paper on efficient hot/cold data identification in storage devices.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python, Algorithm Optimization, Storage Systems
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Hyeonjha/updateMBF)
   - [Research Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9443093)
